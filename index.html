Welcome to my personal website where I talk about my passions, my research, and my interests. You will find an ever-extending mix of posts about my recent papers and projects, as well as my quest to become the most mediocre Magic player.
I aim to keep my CV and my publications up to date. Want to collaborate? Get in touch!
